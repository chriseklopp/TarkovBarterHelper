Singleton
This class will manage the catalog of items and their properties
Items probably stored as a hashtable.
Will initialize from a file containing the necessary information.



May have to scrape this information from
https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Loot

This function will be a part of this module, though it is something that wont need to be used very often.
